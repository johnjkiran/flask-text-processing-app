To be, or not to be: that is the question.
All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
This above all: to thine own self be true.
The course of true love never did run smooth.
Cowards die many times before their deaths.
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.
The better part of Valour, is Discretion.
